### <a name="history"></a>:yum: What is Rita and who are we?

*Rita is the culmination of many things, it started with a mobile game, a community of gamers, a discord server of different languages and a desire to all be understood. She is a Real-Time Translator Bot for use on Discord, and now being brought to life on Guilded. She is maintained by a small group of users, each with different backgrounds and some learning as we go.*

------

#### :world_map: Why did you make Rita on Guilded?

*Guilded is a new oppitunity, a New start, a chace to make Rita from scratch. We were introduced to Guilded and saw the potential to grow in to somthing new. This introduction is the start of a new story in Rita's history.*

------

#### :rocket: The history of Rita?

*There are loads of different translation bots out there for discord, some are amazing, some are expensive, some are free but have limits, and others are just rubbish. but nothing for Guilded, We want to be the first.*

------

#### :star2: Why Rita and what does it stand for?

*I and a group of fellow Rita users decided that collectively we wanted to bring Rita to Guilded. Vast changes will be made, many hours will be spent and soon the Rita will live in a new space, Guilded.*

*Rita's history and various iterations each added something extra, we wanted to keep that same feeling and with the wonderful support from the guilded team, and the warm embrace they have given us we started the process again, to mold Rita into something amazing. We give you the Real-Time Interchangeable Translating Assistant.*

###### *There you have it, the story, dramatised and electrified for effect, but all true, of how Rita on Guilded was born.*
